  description: >-
    <p>Your skill with archery can shape your spellcraft, partially substituting
    for the somatic gestures of traditional spellcasting. With a ranged weapon
    equipped you ignore the free-hand requirement for casting spells that use
    the <strong>Arrow</strong> gesture.</p>

    <p>After performing a <strong>Strike</strong> with a projectile weapon, you
    may cast a spell using the <strong>Arrow</strong> gesture during the same
    Turn with Action Cost reduced by 1.</p>
